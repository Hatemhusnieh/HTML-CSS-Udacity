            <h1>Form Controls</h1>
            <p>There are several types 
            of form controls that
            you can use to collect information
            from visitors to your site.</p><br><br>

            <h1>Form Structure</h1>
            <p>Form controls live inside a
                <`form`> element. This element
                should always carry the action
                attribute and will usually have
                a method and id attribute too.</p>
            <p>Every <`form`> element requires
                an action attribute. Its value
                is the URL for the page on the
                server that will receive the
                information in the form when it
                is submitted.
            </p>
            <p>
                Forms can be sent using one of
                two methods: <b>get</b> or <b>
                post.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                With the get method, the values
                from the form are added to
                the end of the URL specified in
                the action attribute. <b>The get</b>
                method is ideal for:
                <ul> 
                <li>short forms (such as search
                boxes)
                <li>when you are just retrieving
                data from the web server
                (not sending information that
                should be added to or deleted
                from a database)
                </ul>
            </p>
                <`form action=
                "http://www.example.com/subscribe.php"
                method="get"`><br>
                <`p`>This is where the form controls will appear.
                <`/p`>
                <`/form`> <br><br>
                
                <p> With the post method the
                values are sent in what are
                known as HTTP headers. As a
                rule of thumb you should use <b>the
                post</b> method if your form:
                <ul>
                <li>allows users to upload a file
                <li>is very long
                <li>contains sensitive data
                (e.g. passwords)
                <li>adds information to, or
                deletes information from, a
                database
                </ul></p>
