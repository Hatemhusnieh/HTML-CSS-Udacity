        The definition list is created with
        the <`dl`> element and usually
        consists of a series of terms and
        their definitions.
        Inside the <`dl`> element you will
        usually see pairs of <`dt`> (t stands for term)and
        <`dd`> (d stands for difinition) elements.
        <dl>
            <dt>Sashimi</dt>
            <dd>Sliced raw fish that is served with
            condiments such as shredded daikon radish or
            ginger root, wasabi and soy sauce</dd>
            <dt>Scale</dt>

        <h1>Image captions</h1>
        Images often come with
        captions. HTML5 has introduced
        a new <`figure`> element to
        contain images and their caption
        so that the two are associated.
        You can have more than one
        image inside the <`figure`>
        element as long as they all share
        the same caption.<br><br>
        The <`figcaption`> element has
        been added to HTML5 in order
        to allow web page authors to add
        a caption to an image.
        Before these elements were
        created there was no way to
        associate an <`img`> element with
        its caption.
        <figure>
        <img src="mini-ProPic.jpeg" 
        width="100px" height="150px" 
        alt="Photograph me">
        <br />
        <figcaption>The is a creature called Hatem. 
            He is so sofisticated and rare.</figcaption>

            <h1>Tabels</h1>
            The <`table`> element is used
            to create a table. The contents
            of the table are written out row
            by row.<br><br>
            You indicate the start of each
            row using the opening <`tr`> tag.
            (The tr stands for table row.)
            It is followed by one or more
            <`td`> elements (one for each cell
            in that row).<br><br>
            Each cell of a table is
            represented using a <`td`>
            element. (The td stands for
            table data.)
            <table>
              <tr>
              <td>15</td>
              <td>15</td>
              <td>30</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
              <td>45</td>
              <td>60</td>
              <td>45</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
              <td>60</td>
              <td>90</td>
              <td>90</td>
              </tr>
              </table>
            </div>
            <div class= "inner">
            The <`th`> element is used just
            like the <`td`> element but its
            purpose is to represent the
            heading for either a column or
            a row. (The th stands for table
            heading.)<br><br>
            <b>Even if a cell has no content,
            you should still use a <td> or
            <th> element to represent
            the presence of an empty cell
            otherwise the table will not
            render correctly. (The first cell
            in the first row of this example
            shows an empty cell.)</b>
            <table>
              <tr>
              <th></th>
              <th scope="col">Saturday</th>
              <th scope="col">Sunday</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
              <th scope="row">Tickets sold:</th>
              <td>120</td>
              <td>135</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
              <th scope="row">Total sales:</th>
              <td>$600</td>
              <td>$675</td>

            <div class= "inner">
            Sometimes you may need the
            entries in a table to stretch
            across more than one column.
            The <`colspan`> attribute can be
            used on a <`th`> or <`td`> element
            and indicates how many columns
            that cell should run across.
            <table>
              <tr>
              <th></th>
              <th>9am</th>
              <th>10am</th>
              <th>11am</th>
              <th>12am</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
              <th>Monday</th>
              <td colspan="2">Geography</td>
              <td>Math</td>
              <td>Art</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
              <th>Tuesday</th>
              <td colspan="3">Gym</td>
              <td>Home Ec</td>

            <div class= "inner">
            You may also need entries in
            a table to stretch down across
            more than one row.
            The <`rowspan`> attribute can be
            used on a <`th`> or <`td`> element
            to indicate how many rows a cell
            should span down the table.
            <table>
              <tr>
              <th></th>
              <th>ABC</th>
              <th>BBC</th>
              <th>CNN</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
              <th>6pm - 7pm</th>
              <td rowspan="2">Movie</td>
              <td>Comedy</td>
              <td>News</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
              <th>7pm - 8pm</th>
              <td>Sport</td>
              <td>Current Affairs</td>
              </tr>
              </table>

            <div class= "inner">
              further in CSS tables will be styled
              according thier head,body and footer so:
              <br><br>
              The headings of the table should
              sit inside the <`thead`> element.<br><br>
              The body should sit inside the
              <`tbody`> element.<br><br>
              The footer belongs inside the
              <`tfoot`> element.
